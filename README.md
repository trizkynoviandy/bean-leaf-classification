# Bean Leaf Classification

The goal of this project is to create a model that can accurately detect and classify diseases in bean leaves using a dataset of images, which can help farmers identify and treat diseased plants more quickly and effectively. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) will be used to train the model, which has shown great success in image classification tasks.

## Dataset

The [iBean](https://github.com/AI-Lab-Makerere/ibean/) dataset was used for training and evaluating the model. It consists of images of soybean plants with annotations for various plant diseases and health conditions.
